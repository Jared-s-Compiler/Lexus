# Lexus

A lexer written in Flex.
This was built upon the work of [ezaquarii](https://github.com/ezaquarii/bison-flex-cpp-example), which if this did not exist, I have no idea where I would be.
Lexus is meant to be one module of the `Diablo` ecosystem, and as such does not include the parser.
That would inside of `Synthetic`.
